Description: A mass calculator that facilitates the straightforward determination
        of average or monoisotopic masses and elemental compositions for therapeutic 
        glycoproteins, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb), bispecific antibodies (bsAb), 
        and antibody-drug conjugates (ADC).
